      <h1><a id="about">[about]</a></h1>
      <p>Hej! I’m Jacob, a 18-year-old student and entrepreneur from Cincinnati, currently living in San Mateo. I’m currently working on my Associate of Science at Flathead Valley Community College, on a custom degree path for cybernetics. This incorporates aspects of computer science, biotechnology, anatomy & physiology, and surgical technology. Outside of school, I run my startup, <a href="https://anomaly-science.com/" target="_blank">Anomaly Science</a>, a company redefining what it means to create by connecting people with ideas, to individuals with the right technical skills, and giving them the tools they need to bring the ideas to life. I see it as my purpose in life to better the way humanity is. I wish to the best of my ability assist in the development of new technologies that help increase human lifespan, change the way we think, and improve quality of life. When I think about the things that are most important to me in life, one of them is how I will be remembered. I want to leave my mark on the world, and be remembered for the innovations I made and the people I impacted.</p>

      <b>Jacob Standard Time (JCST) // UTC-8</b>
      <p>Jacob Standard Time is a system of time keeping I created, that is UTC+/- whatever I feel like. This system was developed so that I could feel better about maintaining a bad sleep schedule, by adjusting the time zone so I could always go to bed at a reasonable time. The time changes are highly unpredictable and individuals are strongly discouraged from using it.</p>
